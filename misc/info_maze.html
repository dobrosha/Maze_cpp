<h1>DOCUMENTATION MAZE</h1>
<p>MAZE - is an application that allows you to build mazes and find the shortest path.
</p>
<h4>BASIC MAZE FUNCTIONS:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Drawing area, where you can choose the start and end point of the path (Wave Algorithm).</li>
    <li>Uploading file from txt-file (show maze).</li>
    <li>Adjust the height and width of the generate maze (Eller Algorithm).</li>
</ul>
<h4>HOW TO USE:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>First, when you run the program you have the choice to load the maze from a file or "GENERATE".</li>
    <li>You can change the height and width of the maze. Setting height and width in windows.</li>
    <li>Select the start point with the left mouse button and the end point with the right mouse button.</li>
</ul>
<h4>RECOMENDATION:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Upload a file of a certain format that you can find in the dataset.</li>
    <li>Don't use large txt-files.</li>
</ul>
<h3>LET'S TALK ABOUT CAVE</h3>
<p>CAVE - A cave is a certain type of branching location. Such locations can be generated by generation using a cellular automaton.</p>
<h4>BASIC CAVE FUNCTIONS:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Uploading file from txt-file (show cave).</li>
    <li>Adjust the height and width of the generate cave (cellular automaton)</li>
    <li>Run —Åave generation simulation</li>
</ul>
<h4>HOW TO USE:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>First, when you run the program you have the choice to load the cave from a file or "GENERATE".</li>
    <li>You can change the height and width of the cave. Setting height and width in windows.</li>
    <li>Need sets the limits of "birth" and "death" of the cell, as well as the chance for the initial initialization of the cell</li>
    <li>Need to press the step button or adjust the generation speed</li>
</ul>
<h4>RECOMENDATION:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Upload a file of a certain format that you can find in the dataset.</li>
    <li>Don't use large txt-files.</li>
</ul>
